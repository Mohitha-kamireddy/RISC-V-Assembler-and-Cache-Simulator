# RISC-V Assembler and Cache Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a RISC-V based assembler and execution simulator that converts RISC-V assembly instructions into binary machine code and simulates their execution with a modeled cache memory system. The project aims to provide hands-on understanding of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, instruction encoding, and memory hierarchy behavior.



## Features
- Translation of RISC-V assembly instructions to binary machine code  
- Instruction parsing and encoding  
- Register file simulation  
- Memory access handling  
- Cache simulation with hit/miss behavior analysis  
- Execution of RISC-V programs in a simulated environment
